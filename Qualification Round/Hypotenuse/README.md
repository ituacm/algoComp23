# Hypotenuse

Catch the vibe! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTOmQmOFeVo

Love is one of the strongest feelings. Everybody has that unintentional and unwanted void. By loving someone they believe they can fix that. And you know what? A person has a heart on their left side and through hugging they fill their right side as well. The void fills with the love towards other's heart and belonging. Thus hugs make you feel comfort, just as you reach your home from a journey. 

Loving someone itself is a hard companionship. Sometimes arguments and fights occur. However, these entanglements resolve itselves if they value each other. If someone puts their interest first and doesn't listen to the partner and if this behavior continues along the way, a break up is a sure thing. The end of love will be easy for neither. The stages are visible throughout history. Let's prove it with a short voyage to the before christian era. 

Pythagoras has come up with the calculation of Hypotenuse. But he didn't name an arbitrary word for his founding. Hypotenuse originates from "subtending" in Ancient Greek. To fill the void of orthogonal two edges, one line segment comes just like a hug.

The founder of this magical word, Pythagoras' love life is not as great as his mathematical career. His wife Theano complains about why he doesn't use her name instead of Hypotenuse. Because it was expected to use their loved ones' names when philosophers name new foundings. But Pythagoras has already made up his mind and sticks to his decision no matter what. Thenao gave up on him and left a note before leaving. Pythagoras found a hard math question instead of a farewell. 

His wife was well aware that he was obsessed with integer-sided right triangles. She formed her question based upon them.

For a number in a given interval, decide if it and its square root both could be; a hypotenuse for a possible right triangle. For an interval l to r (we read the note but numbers were expunged due to time lapse, thus we will provide possible two numbers), find how many prime numbers would satisfy these conditions. 

At the bottom, it says "I can only return if you manage to solve this.". Try as he might, he died without solving the question. 

Surely, he didn't have computational power. It was pretty tiring and led to miscalculated results over and over again. We couldn't say let's help him out for known reasons. Still, we hope that they will meet in the afterlife.
